Project 5 Udacity Front-end Web Developer Nanodegree

Based on this [Udacity Project 5 rubric](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd001/l-2711658591/m-2684328537).

The site can be found online at [map](https://randalp.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-neighbourhood/site).

Description
============

The map contains information about various ocean pools in the Eastern Suburbs of Sydney. These are sometimes formed in rock, which may have been moved or carved out, or they are cast in concrete. The pools contain sea water and are flushed with the waves and tides.

The locations can be filtered by name and/or suburb using the search box. It is also possible to use the check boxes to include or exclude rock pools and man made pools.

When a location is selected via either the list or the map, it's map marker bounces and and info window is displayed with some basic information. The info window also provides buttons to launch dialog boxes containing weather information and images from flickr respectively. The flickr images are responsive to the screen size.

For mobile screens, the location list is not displayed until the 'hamburger' menu is selected.
